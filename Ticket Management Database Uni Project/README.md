Welcome to my code portfolio! Glad you made it.

I've set up folders for my programming languages where there are individual files with short scripts from when i was learning them.

There also are project folders, the most interesting parts of the repository. 
  - GUI Chess - C and OpenGL - submodule
  - GUI Calculator in C/Win32
  - Basic Text editor in C/Win32 - NOTE: Created whilst following a series of youtube videos explaining win32

Please enjoy your stay and don't hesitate to ask me about anything in here but do remember some of the more basic files are old enough to go to primary school so i might not remember much about them. I tried going through them to commentand explain them but for some of them it wasn't possible or necessary
