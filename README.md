Welcome to my code portfolio! Glad you made it

I've set up folders for my programming languages where there are individual files with short scripts from when i was learning them.

There also are project folders, the most interesting parts of the repository.

Please enjoy your stay and don't hesitate to ask me about anything in here but do remember some of the more basic files are old enough to go to school so i might not remember much about them.
