In here there are 7 scripts that increase in complexity that were designed for a maze environment that we were provided

I can't put a copy of that maze environment in here as that would probably get me in trouble as i don't have rights to it

Regardless this is some of my most recent code so I can explain it if need be. I have include GITHUB COMMENTS in there to help explain the general function of those scripts.
There are also quite detailed preambles that explain decision choices, functionality and anything else that needed to be documented.
